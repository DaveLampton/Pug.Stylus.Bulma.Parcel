# Website.Starter.2019
## Modern Tools. Automated Workflow. Live Updates. More time for you!

**Website.Starter.2019 combines the best Web development tools available today, automates them, and then keeps them out of your way! It facilitates a simplified workflow and makes an excellent starting point for any new Web project.**

You write your code using Pug, Stylus and CoffeeScript, which each provide a clean, simple and powerful syntax which is then compiled into modern, standards-compliant HTML, CSS and JavaScript, respectively, along with their related sourcemaps. Then they are transpiled into the most compatible formats so that they'll run in the largest number of browsers, and they are minified and compressed. Then the bundler intelligently splits code up into packages that are optimized to be "lazy-loaded" as needed, minimizing traffic and maximizing speed. The bundler also gives files unique, versioned names so that they will automatically bust your web caches.

Website.Starter.2019 is a blank canvas for you to build upon. It minimizes developer efforts and human errors, while it maximizes the amount of work delegated to our machines. Finally, Web developers can spend more time leveraging their creativity, solving the higher-level problems and less time fiddling with the mundane details.  You're welcome.  ;^)

* [**Babel**](https://babeljs.io/) - Transpiles various JavaScript versions (ES6/ES7/JSX/etc.) into a single codebase that's cross-broswer compatible.
* [**Parcel**](https://parceljs.org/) - Zero-configuration bundler intelligently splits code and assets into packages optimized for "lazy-loading".

To setup this project, make sure you've installed [node.js](https://nodejs.org/) and [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/), then change to the root directory of this project and run

`npm install`

to download and install all the required dependencies. Then all you need to do is simply type 

`watch`

and the file watchers will come to life.

Now, each time you edit any of the .pug, .styl, or .coffee files under 'templates', you will see LIVE updates in your browser at [**http://127.0.0.1:1234/index.html**](http://127.0.0.1:1234/index.html)

Parcel continually bundles the code and assets, saving its deployment package as the 'dist' directory.

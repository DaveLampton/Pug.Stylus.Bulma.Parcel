# generating them for us), with the exceptions specified below. To have Git
# include other files below webroot, the following settings will need to be
# adjusted accordingly.

# We're excluding from Git all the files under webroot...

# except, we ARE including the .css files within webroot/css/vendor/
# (Other CSS files under webroot/css/ should be generated by Stylus.)
